About me
------

I am a machine learning engineer working at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/). I work on deep learning and computer vision based solutions for industrial and business applications.

I recieved my Bachelors and Masters degree from [National Institute of Technology Rourkela](https://nitrkl.ac.in/), as part of 5 year dual degree course. My research advisors were [Dr. Sarat Kumar Patra](http://iiitvadodara.ac.in/faculty/skp001.php) and [Dr. Siddharth Deshmukh](https://www.nitrkl.ac.in/FProfile.aspx?e=deshmukhs)

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on computer vision and robotics. I was one of the first members of [Team Tiburon - Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Team of NIT Rourkela](https://auvnitrkl.github.io/), where I extensively contributed to its development and led the team at international competitions.

Research Interests
------

I aspire to be a researcher in deep learning. Particularly I'm interested in deep reinforcement learning and meta learning for reinforcement learning. Some of the current research problems I wish to work on are as follows:

- Generalization of deep reinforcement learning algorithms
- Meta Learning for deep reinforcement learning
- Unsupervised Learning for deep reinforcement learning
